            Why are families important? Heavenly Father gave us families to have a place where we are loved
            and where we can be taught the gospel. It is a key unit in His plan for us. I want to be with my family forever.

        <p class="paragraph">
            What is the roll of prophets in proclaiming the doctrine of eternal families? Heavenly Father gives us latter-day prophets
            to help us know what He wants us to do. One good example of this is when “The Family: A Proclamation to the World.” came out.
            It has shown to be very helpful in a world where values shift with popular demand. It has helped me know what doctrine I should 
            be following when it comes to my role as a wife, mother and daughter of God.

            Why is the family central to Heavenly Father's plan, and why do we need a physical body? “the family is central to the Creator’s 
            plan for the eternal destiny of His children” (“The Family: A Proclamation to the World,” ChurchofJesusChrist.org).
            We came to earth to gain a physical body so that we can experience all that God 
            has in store for us. Our bodies are a gift. One of the things we are here to do is to learn to control our bodies by abiding by
            the commandments Heavenly Father has given to us.

        <p class="paragraph">
            Why is marriage important in Heavenly Father's plan? The scriptures say that "neither is the man without the woman". We were 
            designed to work together with each having equal but different rolls to play. These rolls work together to help a family be
            successful through good and hard times. If each is willing to give what they are able to the marriage, it will be a happy one,
            and become an eternal one. 
        </p>
        <h2 class="weekly">Week 5</h2>
        <img src="./Images/davis_family_picture.jpeg" alt="family picture" class="family">
        <p class="paragraph">
            Why do families need to be sealed together? Families love each other. Can you imagine heaven without your family? I can not. When
            we do family history and participate as proxy for our ancestors in the temple, we are sealing our family together. This important 
            work is necessary for the exaltation of all of God's children. Participating in this work is gathering Israel. 
        </p>

        <img src="./Images/WashingtonDC_Temple.jpeg" alt="Washington DC Temple" class="temple">
        <p class="paragraph">
            What is the marriage covenant? The marriage covenant is the new and everlasting covenant. It is the final covenant we make in the
            temple. It seals a husband and wife together for eternity. If this covenant is kept in this life, there is joy. It does not mean
            that hard things will not happen, it means that there are two committed covenant keeping people that will work through those
            hard things together. Looking for Christlike attributes in our spouse and developing those attributes in ourselves will help 
            a marriage to become eternal. When we are sealed in the temple, there is the promise of what can be if we keep the covenant
            we make when we marry.
        </p>
        <h2 class="weekly">Week 7</h2>
        <img src="./Images/Jesus.jpeg" alt="Jesus Christ" class="jesus">
        <p class="paragraph">
            Where should sexual intimacy occur? Sexual intimacy is only to be used between a husband and wife. It is meant
            to bring children into the world and to fortify the relationship between a husband and wife. I chose a picture of
            the Savior because breaking the law of chastity is not outside His reach.
        </p>
        <h2 class="weekly">Week 8</h2>
        <img src="./Images/baby.jpeg" alt="baby" class="baby">
        <p class="paragraph">
            Is having a family still important? When and how many children a couple has is a decision that should be made between them and God. 
            Children are truly a gift. When we have children we are partnering with God in the plan of salvation. Having children brings great
            joy. It is the best and hardest thing I have ever done. I am grateful I am a mother to six wonderful children.
